# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Project overview
The project was all about generating a meme app/meme genarator using react with files created by vite. The project was a scrimba code along.

### personal view 

The scrimba videos where insightful even thou sometimes it was a bit difficult to comprehend what he said. The only thing that i was unhappy with was the fact that when you insert text on the meme, the text appears on the next meme as well. It was an intresting learn thou.

### Challenges

Trying to do the challenges on my own as the videos would instruct, that made me realise that is still have a lot to learn with react.
